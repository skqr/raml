[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skqr/raml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skqr/raml) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/skqr/raml/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/skqr/raml)

This is a small lib containing a RAML API definition document parser, model, and navigator.

The navigator uses something similar to YPATH, but uses URLs to locate portions of the document instead.

It was built for the [GOintegro HATEOAS Lib](https://github.com/skqr/hateoas).
